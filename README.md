Modeling of CPS Framework

This project has the goal of modeling the NIST Public Working Group CPS Framework in UML for export to XSD and other code generated from the UML model. This will enable tool development based on the Framework.

The Framework is combined in this project with the IEC 62259 Use Case standard which provides along with the IEC standard a UML and XMLSchema model of a scaleable Use Case that is ideal to merge with the Framework in composing a property tree that is the model of a CPS.

Initially, an XSD is to be constructed which enables a Use Case to be developed along with the set of CPS actors and analyzed in various Conceptualization Facet activities to produce a model of the CPS actors. Once constructed, a schema-aware editor such as XMLSpy can be used as a gui to capture inputs and produce the machine readable model as an XML instance file.
