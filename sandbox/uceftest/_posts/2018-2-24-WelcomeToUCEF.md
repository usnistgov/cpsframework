# Welcome

The creators of this site are pleased to welcome you to the Universal CPS Environment for Federation (UCEF).

UCEF was created through the efforts of Vanderbilt University and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology for the purpose of exploring the dimensions of Cyber-Physical Systems in multidomain simulated, emulated, and hardware in the loop (HiL) environments.

Please join us by forking this project and contributing to our efforts.

Cheers,
Marty Burns
NIST
