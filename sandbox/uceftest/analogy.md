# A Useful Analogy

To help readers better understand the UCEF and its key elements ([see definitions](https://pages.nist.gov/??/definitions)), this may be a useful analogy.

Consider a symphony orchestra performing the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  

Each one of the various instruments (violins, tympani, trumpets, etc.), instrumentalists, and singers (sopranos, tenors, soloists) is a _Federate_.

The whole ensemble of instruments, instrumentalists, singers, and conductor are the _Federation_.
 
The conductor of the orchestra and chorus is the _Experiment Manager_.

All the parts of The musical score (the sheet music for the first cello, the sheet music for the oboe, and the sheet music for the tenor soloist are the _cyber aspect of the cyber-physical system_. The instruments and orchestral players are the _physical aspect of the cyber-physical system). the people in the orchestra_.

The actual perfomance is the _CPS Experiment_.
