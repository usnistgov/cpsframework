Producer updates the Receiver’s information.\n\t- DELETE means that information is to be deleted. Producer deletes information from the Receiver.\n\t- CANCEL, CLOSE imply actions related to processes, such as the closure of a work order or the cancellation of a control request.\n\t- EXECUTE is used when a complex transaction is being conveyed using a service, which potentially contains more than one verb.\n\t- REPORT is used to represent transferral of unsolicited information or asynchronous information flows. Producer provides information to the Receiver.\n\t- TIMER is used to represent a waiting period. When using the TIMER service, the Information Producer and Information Receiver fields shall refer to the same actor. \n\t- REPEAT is used to indicate that a series of steps is repeated until a condition or trigger event.
